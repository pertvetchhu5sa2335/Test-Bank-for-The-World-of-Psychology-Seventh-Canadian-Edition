1) According to the text, psychology is the scientific study of
2) a. human and animal behaviour.
3) b. thought, perception and emotion.
4) c. conscious and unconscious processes.
5) d. behaviour and mental processes.
6) Correct: Psychology is the scientific study of behaviour and mental processes. The other responses are too narrow in scope.

11) Topic: Factual
12) Objective: 1.1 Define psychology.

13) 2) An understanding of any behaviour or mental process usually begins with
    3) a. influence.
    4) b. explanation.
    5) c. prediction.
    6) d. description.
